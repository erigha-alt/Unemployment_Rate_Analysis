# Unemployment_Rate_Analysis

Unemployment Rate Analysis
Unemployment is a crucial economic indicator that measures the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labor force. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant increase in the unemployment rate worldwide. This project aims to analyze the unemployment rate data, focusing on its trends, variations, and impacts during the COVID-19 period.

Introduction
This project explores the unemployment rate data for various states in India, with a particular focus on the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown. By analyzing the unemployment rate trends before and after the lockdown, we aim to gain insights into the socio-economic effects of the pandemic on employment.

Data Source
The unemployment rate data used in this analysis is sourced from kaggle. It includes information on the estimated unemployment rate, employed population, labor participation rate, and geographical regions for different states in India.
